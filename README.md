# ComboCaster
Combo Caster is an isometric shooter centred around the idea of creating chaos for the player to benefit from. Combos act as a resource, forcing the player to take risks and play effectively in order to use more powerful moves. Random stats are applied to the player and the enemies, but the playerâ€™s stats are able to roll higher if they have a high combo.
